# mSupply Dashboard: Excel report e-mail scheduler

The Open mSupply Dashboard Excel report e-mail scheduler plugin takes data from panels of mSupply dashboard to generate excel reports.

The reports are then emailed to a custom user report group, this report group is curated from the list of mSupply users, pulled from mSupply Dashboard's datasource.

The timing of the scheduler can be set in the plugin.

The app plugin is built with Golang as backend and react as frontend.
